How to improve an online business based on customersâ€™ reviews?
The main objective of this project is to know what the level of customer satisfaction with the quality of clothes is by applying sentiment analysis.

We want also to find out what is the most and least selling items, and which age groups favor to buy specific type of clothes as well.
