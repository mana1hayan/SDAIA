# Women's Fashion Ratings and Reviews



## Abstract 
Online ratings and reviews play a main role for business revenues since customers usually write about their experiences whether positive or negative when purchasing a product through online services.This means the more
complimentary reviews the better income for businesses, but when some buyers are dissatified with the qulity of products, this might cause adverse consequences not only for them but also for other customers because online shoppers can be persuded through these negative reviews for not buying unrecommended clothes. Consiquently, adverse and helpful reviews should be dermined in order to meet customer's satisfication and maintain a good business through machine learning methods (ML). In this project, we will adress this issue by focusing on one category of ML, which is supervised, hence we need to label data for applying sentiment analysis. 


## Data 
The Women's Fashion Reviews dataset has been acquired from kaggle as a .csv file, containing 23486 rows and 10 features. To address the issue, we selecet the two top relevant features, which are the Review Text, and Rating columns. In the Review text feature, consumers have been wrote about their expireince with the quality of clothes, and the other feature is detrmined cutomers' rating scale from 1 till 5, which is selected to label data for Sentiment Analysis tools. In addition, other features have been used for a business insight to detrmine the most and least selling items and the distribution of age group such as Age,Recommended IND, and Department_Name.
