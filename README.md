# Women's Fashion Ratings and Reviews



## Abstract 
Online ratings and reviews play a main role for business revenues since customers usually write about their experiences whether positive or negative when purchasing a product through online services.This means the more
complimentary reviews the better income for businesses, but when some buyers are dissatified with the qulity of products, this might cause adverse consequences not only for them but also for other customers because online shoppers can be persuded through these negative reviews for not buying unrecommended clothes. Consiquently, adverse and helpful reviews should be dermined in order to meet customer's satisfication and maintain a good business through machine learning methods (ML). In this project, we will adress this issue by focusing on one category of ML, which is supervised, hence we need to label data for applying sentiment analysis.
